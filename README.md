## Introduction
> **Context & Motivation**  
> Handling missing data is one of the most common and critical steps in time series analysis. This project aims to **benchmark** different imputation techniques to provide insights into which methods perform best under various scenarios.

## Project Objectives
1. **Compare Multiple Techniques**  
2. **Synthetic vs. Real Datasets**  
   Assess performance on a *synthetic time series*—where the true values are known—and on a *real-world dataset*.
3. **Quantitative & Qualitative Evaluation**
